                        I come from a non-traditional background starting as a self-taught programmer in high school, I went to and won many hackathons gaining a great deal of prize money.
                        Thatâ€™s what made me really interested in the tech industry and lead to my first internship after one of the judges offered me the position.
                        After that internship I decided that I wanted to work as a software engineer or in sales/marketing because of the excitment I get from creating a software product that can make an impact.
                        I made a commitment to leave public school during the middle of my 10th grade year to go to silicon valley and learn more about software development under my brother. 
                        Since then I worked in many early-stage startups which I learned a variety of skills from, began my work experience in software development, and trained to become a SDR at an bootcamp.
