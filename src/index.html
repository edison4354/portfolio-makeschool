                    <p>
                        I come from a non-traditional background starting as a self-taught programmer in high school, I went to and won many hackathons gaining a great deal of prize money.
                        That’s what made me really interested in the tech industry and lead to my first internship after one of the judges offered me the position.
                        After that internship I decided that I wanted to work as a software engineer or in sales/marketing because of the excitment I get from creating a software product that can make an impact.
                        I made a commitment to leave public school during the middle of my 10th grade year to go to silicon valley and learn more about software development under my brother. 
                        Since then I worked in many early-stage startups which I learned a variety of skills from, began my work experience in software development, and trained to become a SDR at an bootcamp.

                        <p>A Hackathon Project - Consumer Skin Cancer Recognition IOS App my team and I built. All the training data is from dermstoscope imaging. 
                        Thus, our project is meant for non-clinical use but for individuals who notice a lesion and would like a quick yet accurate diagnosis via 
                        dermatoscope attachment to smartphone either for personal use or for one-time use at local pharmacies such as a CVS. While the model can run on normal 
                        close-up smartphone images, lighting will be nonideal and the image may be blurry, providing less accurate results. There are other applications 
                        in smartphone app stores that focus on this more layman imaging.</p>
